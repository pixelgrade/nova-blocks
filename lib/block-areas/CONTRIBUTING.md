# Contribute to Block Areas

Bug reports, patches, translations and any kind of contributions are very welcome. When contributing, please ensure you stick to the following guidelines.

## Writing a Bug Report

When writing a bug report...

* [open an issue](https://github.com/wprig/block-areas/issues/new)
* follow the guidelines specified in the issue template

We will take a look at your issue and either assign it keywords and a milestone or get back to you if there are open questions.

## Contributing Code

When contributing code...

* fork the `develop` branch of the repository on GitHub
* make changes to the forked repository
    * write code that is backward-compatible with WordPress 5.0 and PHP 7.0
    * make sure you stick to the [WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/) coding standards
    * make sure you document the code properly
    * test your code with the constant `WP_DEBUG` enabled
* when committing, in addition to a note about the fix, please reference your issue (if present)
* push the changes to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/wprig/block-areas/compare) to the `develop` branch
* follow the guidelines specified in the pull request template

After that we will review the pull-request as soon as possible and either merge it, make suggestions on improvements or ask you for further details about your implementation.

## Providing Translations

When providing translations...

* select the language you would like to contribute to
* provide the missing translations
    * make sure you follow the guidelines outlined in the [Translator Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/expectations/)
    * stick to the translation conventions for your locale (if there are any) - you can find these [here](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/tools/list-of-glossaries-per-locale/)

After having provided translations, a translation editor will review your submissions soon and approve them as appropriate.
